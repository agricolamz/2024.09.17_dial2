  There are 24 dialectal and 8 bilingual corpora of Russian at the Linguistic
  Convergence Laboratory (see the resources page), and more are coming. The 
  DiaL2 project was launched two years ago with an aim to study the linguistic 
  variation found in these corpora. We applied a UDpipe morphological and 
  syntactic parser, manually annotated a set of linguistic features (sometimes
  relistening the recordings in order to check the transcriptions), and 
  implemented statistical models for each feature that predict the probability 
  of divergence from Standard Russian. During the talk we will discuss our 
  results based on several features:
  
  - non-standard marking in numeral constructions (dva dom [two.M house.SG] 
    ‘two houses’);
  - preposition drop (rodilas’ [v] tridcat’ devjatom godu ‘(she) was born (in) 
    nineteen thirty-nine’);
  - non-standard marking in negative existential constructions (ranše sadiki ne 
    byli ‘there were no kindergartens before.’).
  
  As possible predictors in the models, we used sociolinguistic features 
  (gender, year of birth, years of education), measures of collocationality, 
  and some relevant linguistic features. During the work we discovered multiple 
  typos, inconsistent and wrong transcriptions, and corrected a lot of them. 
  Therefore, we started a parallel project dedicated to automatic correction 
  of the Lab’s corpora, which will also be discussed during the talk.
