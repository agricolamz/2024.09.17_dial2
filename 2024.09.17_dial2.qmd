abstract: |
  There are 24 dialectal and 8 bilingual corpora of Russian at the Linguistic
  Convergence Laboratory (see the resources page), and more are coming. The 
  DiaL2 project was launched two years ago with an aim to study the linguistic 
  variation found in these corpora. We applied a UDpipe morphological and 
  syntactic parser, manually annotated a set of linguistic features (sometimes
  relistening the recordings in order to check the transcriptions), and 
  implemented statistical models for each feature that predict the probability 
  of divergence from Standard Russian. During the talk we will discuss our 
  results based on several features:
  
  - non-standard marking in numeral constructions (dva dom [two.M house.SG] 
    ‘two houses’);
  - preposition drop (rodilas’ [v] tridcat’ devjatom godu ‘(she) was born (in) 
    nineteen thirty-nine’);
  - non-standard marking in negative existential constructions (ranše sadiki ne 
    byli ‘there were no kindergartens before.’).
  
  As possible predictors in the models, we used sociolinguistic features 
  (gender, year of birth, years of education), measures of collocationality, 
  and some relevant linguistic features. During the work we discovered multiple 
  typos, inconsistent and wrong transcriptions, and corrected a lot of them. 
  Therefore, we started a parallel project dedicated to automatic correction 
  of the Lab’s corpora, which will also be discussed during the talk.

- extract transcriptions using the `phonfieldwork` R package [@moroz23]
- use the `udpipe` package in order to gather morphological and syntactical annotation
- filter the result table for particular feature selected by a researcher
- annotate standardness of the utterances
- remove fully-standard speakers
- model the standardness of the utterances using sociolinguistic and linguistic features as predictors

# Num constructions

## Non-standard numeral constructions in L2 Russian

```

## Non-standard numeral constructions in L2 Russian

- Variation in numeral constructions (NCs) in bilingual corpora
    - e.g. dva brat vs. dva brata
- Previous research on other L2 Russian varieties
    - Stoynova (2021) on Nanai and Ulcha Russian: evidence for pattern borrowing
- Also mentioned by
    - Shagal (2016: 369-370) for Erzya Russian
    - Rakhilina & Kazkenova (2018: 610) for Kazakh Russian  

## Research questions

- Does the amount of variation in NCs differ across corpora and/or among speakers of the same variety?
- Can variation in NCs be explained in terms of contact influence?
- Do other factors promote or hinder variation in NCs?

## Distribution of n-std forms with different types of numerals

::: {layout="[35,65]"}

- NOM instead of GEN is frequent both with paucals and other numerals
- n-std GEN is attested sporadically 
- other case forms are even less frequent
- only ~45% of n-std expressions could in principle be explained by L1 pattern borrowing

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_num_constr_model_prediction_by_dice_coefficient_education_num_type.png")
```

- Logistic regression: \small `standardness ~ Dice coefficient + year of birth + education + numeral type + gender + (1|L1 family/speaker id)` \normalsize
- Conditional importance of the variables in our model (generalized R squared):
collocationality (Dice coefficient) > education > year of birth > numeral type > gender

## Conclusions

- Variation in NCs is attested in all L2 corpora, but not to the same extent in each of them
- Daghestanian Russian as a more uniform variety, probably due to a lower pervasiveness of Russian in every-day life, especially in the more isolated communities of the highlands
- The variables that turned out to be statistically significant are all logically related to L2 proficiency and exposure to the input, but there is no robust evidence for a contact explanation

# Prepositional drop

## Preposition drop in Russian spoken by Mari and Beserman bilinguals

## Aims and Research Questions

- a corpus-based study of preposition drop (p-drop) in the speech of Mari-Russian and Beserman-Russian bilinguals compared to the speech of Russian monolinguals;
- demonstrate that the prepositions *v* ‘in’, *k* ‘to’, *s* ‘with’ are omitted in the speech of bilinguals more often than in monolinguals’ speech;
- propose some possible explanations for the variation attested across different bilingual speakers.

## Methods and Data

- spontaneous oral speech of 20 Beserman-Russian and Mari-Russian bilinguals;
- total number of tokens ~166,000;
- in comparison with the speech of nine Russian monolinguals.

## Methods and Data

```{r}
#| out-height: 90%

```

## Findings

```{r}
#| out-height: 70%
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_prep_drop_distribution_of_speakers_by_standardness_across_corpora.png")
```

- both bilinguals and monolinguals omit prepositions;
- however, they do it in different contexts and for different reasons

## Findings

```{r}
#| out-height: 60%
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_prep_drop_v_drop_first_sound.png")
```

- In bilinguals, p-drop can possibly be explained by phonetic interference from their native languages (avoiding consonant cluster);
- monolinguals mainly omit prepositions in lexicalized expressions (v obschem ‘in general’).

## Findings: sociolinguistic factors

```{r}
#| out-height: 75%
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_prep_drop_model_prediction_year.png")
```

The older and less educated a person is, the higher the probability of prep-drop in their speech.

## Preposition Drop in Chuvash

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Anna Grishanova"

knitr::include_graphics("images/grishanova.png")
```

## Preposition drop in Chuvash Russian

- The following prepositions were dropped at least once: v ‘in/to’, u ‘at’, na ‘on/to’, s ‘with/from/off’, iz ‘from/of’, do ‘up to/until’, čerez ‘via/through/later’.

- This includes syllabic prepositions (such as na ‘on’) that do not tend to drop in the speech of Mari and Beserman bilinguals:

- [na] kazhdom povorote stolba stoit ‘A pillar stands on every turn’

## Preposition drop in Chuvash Russian

- The omission of syllabic prepositions and sporadic nature of the drop of certain prepositions compelled a more semantic approach to this data. Thus, every context in the dataset was annotated according to four big semantic groups: location, direction, source and time. 
- Another interesting feature found in Chuvash Russian speech was non-standard case usage, in particular the expansion of the Nominative case. Thus, we also annotated instances of non-standard case usage and used the following word’s case as a factor in statistical modeling.

## Preposition drop in Chuvash Russian

We implemented a nested mixed effect logistic regression model. 

Sociolinguistic factors like **age** and **years of education** appeared to be not  significant. The significant factors turned out to be: 

- semantics of the prepositional phrase
- the plosiveness of the following word’s first sound
- the Nominative case of the following word
- dice coefficient
- the standardness of the following word’s case

## Preposition drop in Chuvash Russian

```{r}
#| out-height: 75%
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_prep_drop_model_plosive.png")
```

The plosiveness of the following word’s first sound increases the probability of a preposition drop

## Preposition drop in Chuvash Russian

```{r}
#| out-height: 72%
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_prep_drop_model_case.png")
```

The Nominative or a non-standard case of the following wordform increase the probability of a preposition drop

## Preposition drop in Chuvash Russian

```{r}
#| out-height: 70%
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_prep_drop_model_semantics.png")
```

On the other hand, the semantics of the prepositional phrase not being that of location, direction, source and time decrease the probability of a preposition drop. 

## Preposition drop in Chuvash Russian

```{r}
#| out-height: 70%
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_prep_drop_model_dice.png")
```

Finally, just like in the study of preposition drop in the speech of Mari and Beserman bilinguals, higher degree of collocationality (dice coefficient) decreases the probability of the omission of a preposition. 

# Gen Pl Forms

## Motivation

- widespread feature
- was studied in standard Russian & bilingual varieties
- in standard Russian some special numerative forms tend to appear in numeral constructions (Kholodilova, forthcoming)
- dialect speech may be controversial to the tendencies observed in other colloquial varieties

## Examples

- Num(not-paucal)~nom,acc,gen~ + N~m,n-Gen.Pl~
    - pjat’ xozjaev-\alert{ov} (dial. five owner-Gen.Pl)
    - pjat’ xozja-ev-Ø (stnd. five owner-Pl-Gen)
- Num(paucal)~acc,gen~ + N~m,n-Gen.Pl~
    -  tridcat-i dv-ux god-\alert{ov} (dial. thirty-Gen two-Gen year-Gen.Pl)
    - tridcat-i dv-ux let-Ø (stnd. thirty-Gen two-Gen year-Gen.Pl)
    
## Research questions

- What factors may affect the probability of use of dialect Gen.Pl forms in numeral
constructions?
    - Overall frequency of dialect Gen.Pl in different contexts
    - Noun stem
    - Numeral-Noun collocationality level
    - Numeral form (Nom/Gen)
    - Year of birth
    - Education level
    - Gender
- Does dialect “overuse” [@kasatkin05] of the -*ov* ending affect cases like *kilogram* vs
*kilogram-ov*?

## Does dialect “overuse” of the -*ov* ending affect measure words?

\pause

No

| lexeme     | -*ov* | Ø  | total | percentage of Ø forms |
|------------|-------|----|-------|--------------------|
| *hectare*  | 2     | 25 | 27    | 93%                |
| *kilogram* | 2     | 76 | 78    | 97%                |
| *gram*     | 0     | 58 | 58    | 100%              |

## Does noun stem play a role?

\pause

Yes

| stem type | dialect | standard | total | dialect share |
|-----------|---------|----------|-------|---------------|
| 1 – t     | 503     | 1297     | 1800  | 28%           |

| 6 – a     | 0       | 2        | 2     | 0%            |
| 7 – I     | 0       | 1        | 1     | 0%            |

Fisher exact test p-value = 0.0004998


## Geographical distribution

## Does overall frequency of dialect Gen.Pl significant?

## Is year of birth significant?

## Is education level significant?

## Is the level of collocationality significant?

## Is the numeral form significant?

## Conclusions

- Dialect “overuse” of the -*ov* ending doesn’t affect mesuare words: zero inflexion forms (*kilogram*) are found in more than 90% of contexts
- Early year of birth & low education level make the probability of using dialect
Gen.Pl form higher
- ‘The most frequent pairs survive’ (Chiara): the probability of dialect form
higher for nouns which often cooccur with numerals
- The type of noun stem seems to be significant
- Potential contact influence in the case of Spiridonova Buda? (Belorussian)
- The correlation between the frequency of dialect Gen.Pl forms in numeral
constructions and other types of contexts is questionable

# Neg Exist constructions

## Negative Existential Constructions

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("images/naccarato.jpg")

```

## Negative Existential Constructions

- Existential negation = negation strategies used in existential sentences of the type *there is/are no* X (*somewhere*), in which the subject is typically non-referential
- We use the terms “existential negation” and “negative existential constructions” (NECs) in a wider sense to include constructions that are sometimes referred to as “locative negation” (*X is/are not in some place*, in which X is a definite subject) and “possessive negation” (*Y does/do not have X*); cf. [@veselinova13 110--111]
- All of them predicate absolute absence rather than relative absence, and Russian employs one and the same strategy in all three cases, which is different from the strategy employed in standard negation, i.e. negation of overt verb predicates

## Non-standard marking in NECs

- Variation in NECs in bilingual corpora (+ comparison with the monolinguals’ variety of Russian spoken in Zvenigorod)

e.g. *gaz ne bylo* vs. *gaza ne bylo*

- Previous research on other L2 Russian varieties
    - Nanai and Ulcha Russian [@stoynova19: 27]
    - Moksha Russian [@kashkin20: 116]
    - Hill Mari Russian [@kashkin22: 39]
- Usually treated as a contact phenomenon because in the L1s of Russian bilinguals who display this trait there is no genitive (or any other special) marking of negated subjects

## Research questions

- Does the amount of variation in NECs differ across corpora and/or among speakers of the same variety?
- Can variation in NECs be explained in terms of contact influence?
- Do other factors promote or hinder variation in NECs?

## The database and parameters of data annotation

## Types of non-standard marking

- Neuter copula
    - *gaz ne bylo*

- Non-neuter copula
    - *dom[a]{.underline} ne byl*

- Agreeing subject (could be pattern borrowing for Daghestan)
    - *bogatye ljudi ne byli*

## Statistical modelling

## Preliminary conclusions

- Findings comparable to those obtained for NCs
- Variation attested in all L2 corpora, but not to the same extent in each of them
- Daghestan as a more uniform variety
- Not all cases of variation can be explained by contact
