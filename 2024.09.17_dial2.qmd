  There are 24 dialectal and 8 bilingual corpora of Russian at the Linguistic
  Convergence Laboratory (see the resources page), and more are coming. The 
  DiaL2 project was launched two years ago with an aim to study the linguistic 
  variation found in these corpora. We applied a UDpipe morphological and 
  syntactic parser, manually annotated a set of linguistic features (sometimes
  relistening the recordings in order to check the transcriptions), and 
  implemented statistical models for each feature that predict the probability 
  of divergence from Standard Russian. During the talk we will discuss our 
  results based on several features:
  
  - non-standard marking in numeral constructions (dva dom [two.M house.SG] 
    ‘two houses’);
  - preposition drop (rodilas’ [v] tridcat’ devjatom godu ‘(she) was born (in) 
    nineteen thirty-nine’);
  - non-standard marking in negative existential constructions (ranše sadiki ne 
    byli ‘there were no kindergartens before.’).
  
  As possible predictors in the models, we used sociolinguistic features 
  (gender, year of birth, years of education), measures of collocationality, 
  and some relevant linguistic features. During the work we discovered multiple 
  typos, inconsistent and wrong transcriptions, and corrected a lot of them. 
  Therefore, we started a parallel project dedicated to automatic correction 
  of the Lab’s corpora, which will also be discussed during the talk.

## Non-standard numeral constructions in L2 Russian

- Variation in numeral constructions (NCs) in bilingual corpora
    - e.g. dva brat vs. dva brata
- Previous research on other L2 Russian varieties
    - Stoynova (2021) on Nanai and Ulcha Russian: evidence for pattern borrowing
- Also mentioned by
    - Shagal (2016: 369-370) for Erzya Russian
    - Rakhilina & Kazkenova (2018: 610) for Kazakh Russian  

## Research questions

- Does the amount of variation in NCs differ across corpora and/or among speakers of the same variety?
- Can variation in NCs be explained in terms of contact influence?
- Do other factors promote or hinder variation in NCs?

## The database and parameters of data annotation

4,144 observations

```

## Distribution of n-std forms with different types of numerals

::: {layout="[35,65]"}

- NOM instead of GEN is frequent both with paucals and other numerals
- n-std GEN is attested sporadically 
- other case forms are even less frequent
- only ~45% of n-std expressions could in principle be explained by L1 pattern borrowing

## Statistical modelling

#| out-width: 80%
#| fig-align: center

knitr::include_graphics("images/l2_num_constr_model_prediction_by_dice_coefficient_education_num_type.png")
```

- Logistic regression: \small `standardness ~ Dice coefficient + year of birth + education + numeral type + gender + (1|L1 family/speaker id)` \normalsize
- Conditional importance of the variables in our model (generalized R squared):
collocationality (Dice coefficient) > education > year of birth > numeral type > gender

## Conclusions

- Variation in NCs is attested in all L2 corpora, but not to the same extent in each of them
- Daghestanian Russian as a more uniform variety, probably due to a lower pervasiveness of Russian in every-day life, especially in the more isolated communities of the highlands
- The variables that turned out to be statistically significant are all logically related to L2 proficiency and exposure to the input, but there is no robust evidence for a contact explanation

## Negative Existential Constructions

- Existential negation = negation strategies used in existential sentences of the type *there is/are no* X (*somewhere*), in which the subject is typically non-referential
- We use the terms “existential negation” and “negative existential constructions” (NECs) in a wider sense to include constructions that are sometimes referred to as “locative negation” (*X is/are not in some place*, in which X is a definite subject) and “possessive negation” (*Y does/do not have X*); cf. [@veselinova13 110--111]
- All of them predicate absolute absence rather than relative absence, and Russian employs one and the same strategy in all three cases, which is different from the strategy employed in standard negation, i.e. negation of overt verb predicates
